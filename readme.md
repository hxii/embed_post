# Embed Post

This plugin allows you to embed posts into other posts.
## Why?
Someone needed this capability and did not have it. 10 minutes later you can use a shortcode. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Usage
Simply use the `[embed_post post_id=19]` shortcode with the post_id that you need.
You can also use `class=class_name` if you'd like to have your own style of embed.
Two styles are currently built-in: default and seamless.
